 --- the matlab codes used to generate the curves of the experiments


============================ Matlab codes ========================================

 -1- Original version of the Bayesian Online Change-point detector (BOCD.m)
 -2- Original version of the detector with a restart criterion (BOCD_restart.m)

 -3- Modified version of the detector with a simpler prior (BOCDm.m)
 -4- Modified version of the detector with a restart criterion (BOCDm_restart.m) --> The one analyzed in the paper.

 -5- demo.m is a demonstration of the four algorithms (BOCD, BOCDm, BOCD_restart, BOCDm_restart)
	in a piece-wise Bernoulli environment

 ----> For a demo please launch the following script: demo.m
