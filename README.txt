This folder contains:

 --- the matlab codes of four versions of the Bayesian Online Change-point detector


============================ Matlab codes ========================================

 -1- Original version of the Bayesian Online Change-point detector (BOCD.m)
 -2- Original version of the detector with a restart criterion (BOCD_restart.m)

 -3- Modified version of the detector with a simpler prior (BOCDm.m)
 -4- Modified version of the detector with a restart criterion (BOCDm_restart.m) 

 -5- demo.m is a demonstration of the four algorithms (BOCD, BOCDm, BOCD_restart, BOCDm_restart)
	in a piece-wise Bernoulli environment

 ----> For a demo please launch the following script: demo.m
